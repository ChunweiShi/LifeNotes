# Preface

This book is a supplement to "Linear Algebra Done Right" and is written by me as I am still learning the subject.&#x20;

It aims to deepen my and the reader's understanding of linear algebra by addressing difficult problems and concepts with additional explanations. I apologize in advance for any errors in the book.

With that, let's start our journey!
